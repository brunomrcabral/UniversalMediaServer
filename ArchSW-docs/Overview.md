###Universal Media Server 
Universal Media Server is a media server, developed using Java, capable of sharing  videos, audio and images to any DLNA-capable device ( Digital Living Network Alliance)  basically it is a set of interoperability guidelines for sharing digital media among multimedia devices. DLNA works with cable and satellite  to provide link protection on each end of the data transfer.
Universal Media Server is also a DLNA-compliant UPnP media server ( Universal Plug and Play ) is a set of networking protocols that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, Internet gateways, Wi-Fi access points and mobile devices to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish functional network services for data sharing, communications, and entertainment. UPnP is intended primarily for residential networks without enterprise-class devices.

It allows streaming to many devices including Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) and PlayStation 4 (PS4), Microsoft Xbox One and 360, many TVs (Samsung, Panasonic, Sony, Vizio, LG, Philips, Sharp), smart phones (iPhone, Android, etc.), Blu-ray players, and more.

Originally it was based on PS3 Media Server which allows the user to access windows media player that's on your computer. If the user is sharing the media player, the ps3 media server will pick up whatever is added to windows media player.Which in time allows the user to have access to any recently added content in the computer using the ps3 system which in turn makes it much easier and faster than burning disks to watch a new movie or listen to the new album the user just downloaded.

Although being based on PS3 Media Server , Universal Media Server , has some enhancements over its predecessor which include web interface support for non-DLNA devices, more supported renderers , automatic bit rate adjustment, and many other transcoding improvements.

###Compatibility
Universal Media Server supports all major operating systems, with versions for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The program streams  many different media formats with little or no configuration. It is powered by MEncoder, FFmpeg, tsMuxeR, MediaInfo, VLC, OpenSubtitles.org and more, which combine to offer support for a wide range of media formats , allowing the user to obtain any subtitle and to play any type of video format without having to look for a video player that is able to decode it either it being a .mkv,.mp4,.flv.,.wmv, .avi or .3gp .

###Dependencies

This software requires Java and mediainfo (mediainfo openjdk-7-jre). Optionally, dcraw and VLC can also be used with Universal Media Server.
